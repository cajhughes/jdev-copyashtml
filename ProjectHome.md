# Copy As HTML/RTF #

Extends the [Oracle JDeveloper](http://www.oracle.com/technology/jdev) and [Oracle SQL Developer](http://www.oracle.com/technology/products/database/sql_developer/index.html) IDEs to provides options to copy the selected text as formatted HTML or RTF (rather than just text).  A number of formatting options are available, and the desired option can be specified by selecting the "Copy As HTML/RTF" node in the Preferences dialog.

The extension can be invoked via:

  * The top-level Edit menu
  * The top-level toolbar button
  * The context menu within the Code Editor
  * The keyboard shortcut (initially assigned to Ctrl-H)
